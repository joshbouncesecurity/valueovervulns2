Hi there! My name is  and my job/passion is helping organizations to build secure software!


I generally go by my real name but in some places I use my handles “tghosth” or  “AppSec Ghost” , hence my avatar.


If you are looking for help building or getting higher value from your Application Security Programme, your best option is to contact me on my work address [josh@bouncesecurity.com](mailto:josh@bouncesecurity.com.). For more information, see the [Bounce Security website](https://www.bouncesecurity.com/).
